# **LoreFlow â€“ Effortless, Structured World-Building**  

### **ðŸ”¹ What is LoreFlow?**  
LoreFlow is a **structured, intuitive world-building tool** that helps **writers, RPG game masters, and creatives** seamlessly organize their worlds.  

Managing loreâ€”characters, locations, artifactsâ€”can be **overwhelming**. Existing tools lack structure or are difficult to navigate. LoreFlow solves this with a **template-driven system** that lets you **define, edit, and manage world-building elements effortlessly.**  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Features**
âœ… **Template-Driven System** â€“ Define and customize structured **Lore Template Types (`.ltt`)** to ensure consistency across world-building elements.  
âœ… **Easy-to-Use Interface** â€“ No coding requiredâ€”just **intuitive form-based input** for creating and editing **Lore Files (`.ltf`)**.  
âœ… **File-Based Organization** â€“ Use your **native file system** to categorize lore entries, keeping everything **local, portable, and flexible**.  
âœ… **Linked Data & Relationships** â€“ Connect characters, locations, and items through **UUID-based references**, ensuring seamless navigation.  
âœ… **Powerful Search & Indexing** â€“ Quickly find any **NPC, artifact, or setting** in your world-building archive.  
âœ… **Offline & Private** â€“ No cloud dependencyâ€”**your world, your data**.  

### **Why LoreFlow?**  
Because **world-building should be structured, intuitive, and frictionless**â€”so your creativity can flow.

## **ðŸ”¹ Current Status of the Project**
ðŸ“Œ **LoreFlow is in early development.**  

We are currently **defining the foundation**â€”**Lore Template Types (`.ltt`)**, **Lore Files (`.ltf`)**, and the **file-based approach**. With the tech stack finalized, we are preparing to **build the first version** of the software.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Roadmap & Development Plan**
LoreFlow is being developed in **phases**, focusing on **functionality first, then UI refinements**.  

### **ðŸ›  Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
âœ… **Define File Formats** â€“ `.ltt` for templates, `.ltf` for data entries. (Done)  
âœ… **Select Tech Stack** â€“ Go (Wails) + React + Zustand + Tailwind. (Done)  
ðŸŸ¡ **Initialize Codebase** â€“ Set up Wails project and GitHub repo.  
ðŸŸ¡ **Implement File Handling** â€“ Read/write `.ltt` and `.ltf` files.  
ðŸŸ¡ **Build Template Editor** â€“ UI for creating and managing `.ltt` templates.  

---

### **ðŸŽ¨ Phase 2: Core UI & Editing Features**
ðŸŸ¡ **Lore Entry Editor** â€“ Form-based UI for creating and editing `.ltf` files.  
ðŸŸ¡ **File Dialog Integration** â€“ Open/save files via Wails native dialogs.  
ðŸŸ¡ **UUID-Based Linking** â€“ Allow linking entries (e.g., NPCs to locations).  
ðŸŸ¡ **Basic Search & Filtering** â€“ Quickly find lore entries via tags.  

---

### **ðŸš€ Phase 3: Refinements & Advanced Features**
ðŸŸ¡ **Polish UI & Styling** â€“ Improve user experience with Tailwind CSS.  
ðŸŸ¡ **Auto-Saving & File Watcher** â€“ Keep files updated in real time.  
ðŸŸ¡ **Export & Sharing** â€“ Markdown/PDF export for sharing lore.  
ðŸŸ¡ **Testing & User Feedback** â€“ Refine usability based on early testers.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack**
âœ… **Frontend:** **React + Zustand + Tailwind CSS** (Modern, responsive UI).  
âœ… **Backend:** **Go (Wails framework)** (Native speed, direct bindings).  
âœ… **Data Storage:** **Flat Files (`.ltf/.ltt`)**, No Database (Portable, lightweight).  
âœ… **File Handling:** **Wails File Dialogs** (Native OS integration for opening/saving).  

ðŸ“Œ **Why Wails?**  
- **Lightweight & Fast** â€“ Unlike Electron, Wails **doesnâ€™t bundle Chromium**, keeping the app small (~10MB).  
- **Cross-Platform** â€“ Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** as a **single `.exe/.app`** without cloud dependencies.  
- **Direct Integration** â€“ **No need for REST APIs**â€”the frontend directly communicates with Go functions.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Who Is This For?**
âœ… **RPG Game Masters** â€“ Organize structured campaign notes.  
âœ… **Writers & Authors** â€“ Manage world-building details easily.  
âœ… **Game Developers** â€“ Store structured lore for in-game use.  
âœ… **Creatives** â€“ Keep track of **characters, locations, and artifacts** without clutter.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Next Development Milestones**
Since LoreFlow is in early development, we are focusing on **building the foundation first.**  

ðŸ”¹ **Initialize the GitHub Repo & Codebase** â€“ Set up the Wails project.  
ðŸ”¹ **Build the `.ltt` Template Editor** â€“ First working feature.  
ðŸ”¹ **Implement `.ltf` File Handling** â€“ Creating & saving lore entries.  
ðŸ”¹ **Release an Early Prototype** â€“ Gather feedback from early testers.  

With **LoreFlow**, your world-building stays **structured, intuitive, and frictionless**â€”so your creativity can **flow**. ðŸš€
